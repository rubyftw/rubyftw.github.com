[RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com) is a robust, scalable, and easy-to-use message broker implemented on the [Advanced Message Queue Protocol](http://www.amqp.org/).  Dan Swain will describe the basic ideas of using RabbitMQ - brokers, exchanges, channels, queues, etc., and how to work with the Ruby RabbitMQ client library, [Bunny](http://rubybunny.info/).  He'll give a couple examples of basic use cases, and share some insights from his experience of using RabbitMQ at [Simpli.fi](http://simpli.fi).
