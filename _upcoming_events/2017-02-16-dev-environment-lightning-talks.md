How do you roll? What IDE do you use? How do you install your tools? Lightning
talks are super short, pretty informal, and focused on just a few things. Please
come to watch, and if you've got anything about your set up that might benefit
others, come prepared to speak.

I think it would great to see at least one talk that is focused on Development
Environments for New Developers.
