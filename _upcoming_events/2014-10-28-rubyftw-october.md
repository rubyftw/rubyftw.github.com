Our own Byron Appelt and Troy Nichols participated in the 2014 Rails Rumble and will share some of their learnings and experiences build GemPact. GemPact calculates a measure of a RubyGems impact by computing a score “GemPact Factor” based on how many other RubyGems declare the Gem as a dependency.

The GemPact site allows you to view the list of gems that use any other gem. You can also generate a badge to display the GemPact Factor of any RubyGem.

This was inspired by the practice within academic journals of calculating scores based on the number of citations a paper or journal gets in other journals, sometimes called the Impact Factor.
