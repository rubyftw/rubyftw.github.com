Kurt Johnson, Senior application developer on the Real Time Bidding team at Simpli.fi will present "Everything I know about Elixir."  Elixir has an elegant, simple syntax and ecosystem inspired by Ruby, but with a functional programming style based on Erlang, the programming language that has powered the telecom industry since the 70's.  In short, Elixir combines the succinctness, expressiveness and productivity of Ruby with the concurrency strengths of the rock solid Erlang VM.  Come hear Kurt speak on Elixir basics.
