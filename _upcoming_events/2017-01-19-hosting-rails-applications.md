We'll be discussing the various hosting approaches we are taking for Rails apps, including:

- AWS
- Heroku
- ...and anything else anyone in the group is trying.

We'll talk about database backends, scaling, DNS, etc. and Dave will be showing us the TroopTrack AWS configuration as an example.

Pizza will arrive at about 6PM and we will get started with the presentation/discussion around 6:30.
