[Rails 5 RC1 is here][rails]. Have you played with it yet? Are you worried about the upgrade? Some of us have done greenfield development with it. Others have already upgraded 4.2 apps to 5. Want to hear what that's been like? Want to share what you've found already?

Then come. Eat pizza. Drink free Dr. Pepper! And share your experience, if you have one, or listen to others share theirs.
