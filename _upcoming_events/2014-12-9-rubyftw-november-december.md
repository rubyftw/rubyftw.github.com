Come prepared with something to share:

* How did you get into web develompent, or programming in general? Whether youâ€™ve been at it 20 years or 20 days, we want to hear your story.
* Best/worst code of 2014
* Something else (shouldn't have to mention this, but please try to stay on the topic of Ruby)
