Where am I and what's around me? GPS and Wifi are already in use to provide location, but 
it's not good enough to tell specifically where you are inside a building. I transformed 
my office building into an airport using a combination of Rails, Objective-C, and a number 
of hardware hacks with the goal of providing a better in-airport experience with precise 
indoor geolocation.
