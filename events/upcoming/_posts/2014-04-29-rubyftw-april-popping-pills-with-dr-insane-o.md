Presented by Erik Potter:

>Dr. Insane-o is an attempt to port the classic NES game Dr. Mario while adding some much needed features. I'll talk about simple video game design concepts and how you can use HTML5 (and abuse angular.js) to prototype your game. I'll also explore the role of WebSockets and event-driven servers to add multi-player, real-time gameplay. My talk will culminate in a live demo (what could go wrong?) where talk attendees will get to go head to head on the big screen.

>The game's written in Python but the code and ideas should be easily accessible for Ruby folks.
