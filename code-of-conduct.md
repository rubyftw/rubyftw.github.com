Ruby FTW is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating
these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from any or all meetings at the discretion of the meeting
organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem
appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meeting. If you are being
harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an
organizer immediately. They will happy to help participants contact security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
duration of the meeting. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all venues and related social events.
