Ryan Bell, CTO of TroopTrack.com will talk about his experience with the Crystal language, a new ruby-like language that is extremely fast for native operations and is Ryan's new tech crush. Bring all the empathy you can muster cuz Ryan is totally smitten and will gush on and on like that awkward friend of yours in college who went on a date with someone who actually liked him back. Oh, wait... I was just like that too. Doh.
