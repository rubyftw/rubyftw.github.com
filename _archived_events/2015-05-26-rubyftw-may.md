The title is totally clickbait. Both frameworks are great.

Dan Swain will talk a little bit about [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and the [Phoenix framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/).  He'll show how he's ported part of an app from Rails to Phoenix.  This isn't an advertisement for Elixir and Phoenix; he's going to talk about what seems to work well in Phoenix vs. where Rails might still be better.
