Ryan Bell is the CTO of [TroopTrack.com](http://trooptrack.com), the largest software company in Parker County.* He's been writing software for about 30 years and is generally curmudgeonly in spite of still being pretty young. He is also a nationally recognized athlete and has won numerous medals in Taekwondo at the state and national level. Ryan is, among other things, completely sick of "undefined method * for nil" exceptions and other exceptions that are unique to dynamic languages. He hates them and is on a quest to kick every last one of them in the throat. 

Which brings us to Elm. Elm is a typed language that compiles to Javascript and unequivocally prevents type exceptions. Ryan's been dating Elm for the last year and, sources tell me, is getting close to announcing nuptials. In this meetup, we're going to learn why Ryan loves Elm and why maybe you should too.

We might also talk a bit about Electron, the technology behind the Atom IDE and other cool products like Slack. 


\*Anecdotally. We've never actually checked. We're pretty sure TroopTrack is the *ONLY* software company in Parker County!
